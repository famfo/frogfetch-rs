# frogfetch-rs
This is a stupid little project I did because I was bored, maybe I have the motivation somewhen to improve it.

### Building/Running
1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run with `cargo run` or build a binary with `cargo build --release`

Note: this was only tested on X11 Linux, this won't work on Windows and I can't guarantee that this works as expected on Wayland and BSD.
