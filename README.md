# frogfetch-rs
This is a stupid little project I did because I was bored, maybe I have the motivation somewhen to improve it.

### Building/Running
1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run with `cargo run` or build a binary with `cargo build --release`

Note: this currently only works on Linux and will panic on all other operating systems
